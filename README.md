ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sergius.

I have been interested in programming since childhood, for more than 25 years. I have been working as a full-stack developer for over 15 years and have written a project from scratch, now I am maintaining it and writing a new version. I use my framework for application logic on the client and third-party libraries for interface design.
In general, technology does not matter, the main thing is a creative approach and love for your work.
